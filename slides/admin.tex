		{\color{myOrange}{\textbf{Final year is tough}}} : many competing demands on your time
	\end{exampleblock}
	%\vspace{6pt}
	%Some tips:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\textbf{Manage your time}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Recognize that lectures are $\sim$ 25\% of the work for this course
			\item	Plenty of work outside the class: at least 7+ hours per week
			\item	Prioritize events in your academic life over your social life: yes ... \emph{just for the next 8 months}
			\item	And you will likely have to work 1 day per weekend (not only on 4N, but other courses also)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Some unsolicited advice}
	\begin{columns}[c]
		\column{0.65\textwidth}
			%{\color{white}asd}
			%vspace{-2cm}
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	\textbf{Exercise} 3 to 5 times per week
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	at minimum: a 20 min walk around campus to clear your head
					\item	join the Pulse
					\item	join a group class ... with your group members, do a cardio circuit, jog, push-ups, yoga, weights, \emph{etc}
				\end{itemize}
				\pause
				\item	\textbf{Discuss} with your group members how you work is going
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	communicate, communicate, communicate, communicate
				\end{itemize}
				\item	\textbf{Eat well}: ``garbage-in garbage-out'' applies to bioreactors ... i.e. your body
				\item	\textbf{Sleep}: regular all-nighters are no good

		\item	Group presentation of tutorial questions in the last 30 minutes
		\item	Remaining questions due on next Wednesday {\scriptsize (with cover page)}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{SDL Project}
	A major component of the course is the self-directed learning (SDL) project.

	\vspace{12pt}
	Tutorials will also be run in an SDL manner, to help you learn this skill.

	\vspace{12pt}
	I will cover the SDL topic and scope in 3 weeks time.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why group-based work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Groups of 5 members will be created
		\item	$1+1+1+1+1 > 5$: magnify your strengths
		\item	You will always work in groups after graduation
		\item	Why do companies require group (team)work? \seefull{Turton, Ch 28}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Variety of viewpoints and expertise are brought together
			\item	Time constraints
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{12pt}
		\pause
		Our case might be a little unrealistic though:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	You might often be the only (chemical) engineer on a team in a company
			\item	But that means you have to know \textbf{all your stuff}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Group selection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	How the process works: \textbf{mutual selection}. You get to name 3 members you'd like to work with
		\item	But:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	TAs and myself will ultimately form the groups
			\item	We will try to select at least 2 of the people you choose
			\item	Tutorial slots evenly allocated
			\item	Not too many people of same stream in group
			\item	Similar interests, but also accommodate differences
			\item	Randomness
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Over to you ...}
	Please \href{http://yint.org/groups}{fill out the online questionnaire} [http://yint.org/groups] \textbf{by the end of today} if possible, but it will be available until Sunday at 18:00.
