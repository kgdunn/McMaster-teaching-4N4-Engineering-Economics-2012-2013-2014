\begin{frame}\frametitle{Some unsolicited advice}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		{\color{myOrange}{\textbf{Final year is tough}}} : many competing demands on your time
	\end{exampleblock}
	%\vspace{6pt}
	%Some tips:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\textbf{Manage your time}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Recognize that lectures are $\sim$ 25\% of the work for this course
			\item	Plenty of work outside the class: at least 8 to 9 hours per week
			\item	Prioritize events in your academic life over your social life: yes ... \emph{just for the next 8 months}
			\item	And you will have to work on weekends, at least 1 day (not only on 4N, but other courses also)
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item	\textbf{Exercise} 3 to 5 times per week
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	at minimum: a 20 min walk around campus to clear your head
			\item	join the Pulse
			\item	join a group class ... with your group members, do a cardio circuit, jog, push-ups, yoga, weights, \emph{etc}
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item	\textbf{Discuss} with your group members how you work is going
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	communicate, communicate, communicate
		\end{itemize}
		\item	\textbf{Eat well}: ``garbage-in garbage-out'' applies to bioreactors ... i.e. your body
		\item	\textbf{Sleep}: regular all-nighters are no good
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Trouble?}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		\vspace{12pt}
		Things not going well? {\color{Brown}{Please communicate \emph{early}}}.
		\vspace{12pt}
	\end{exampleblock}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	You will provide anonymous peer feedback regularly. I will monitor this and step in where necessary.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Grading}
	\begin{tabular}{lc}
		Group-submitted assignment/tutorials 					& \textbf{25\%} \\
		Group project (meeting, interim and final reports)		& \textbf{28\%} \\
		Midterm test											& \textbf{10\%} \\
		Final exam												& \textbf{25\%} \\
		Online questions, reflections and written peer feedback	& \textbf{12\%}
	\end{tabular}

	\vspace{24pt}
	Course letters will be assigned using standard system
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Midterms and exam}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Midterm: process economics section
		\item	Final exam: on everything, including economics
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{24pt}
	All tests and exams:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	open notes -- any form of paper
		\item	any calculator
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Tutorials}
	Tutorial slots \textbf{A} (\emph{morning}) and \textbf{B} (\emph{afternoon}) on Mondays:

	\begin{itemize}
		%\item	1 question from the tutorial due as group hand-in {\scriptsize (no cover page)}
		\item	Group presentation of each tutorial question in the last 30 minutes {\scriptsize (for grades)}
		\item	Remaining questions due on next Friday {\scriptsize (with cover page)}
		\item	Please have an internet-enabled device in the tutorial (at least one per group)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{SDL Project}
	A major component of the course is the self-directed learning (SDL) project.

	\vspace{12pt}
	Tutorials will also be run in an SDL manner, to help provide skills.

	\vspace{12pt}
	I will cover the SDL topic and scope in 3 weeks time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why group-based work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Groups of 5 members will be created
		\item	$1+1+1+1+1 > 5$: magnify your strengths
		\item	You will always work in groups after graduation
		\item	Why do companies require group (team)work? \seefull{Turton, Ch 28}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Variety of viewpoints and expertise are brought together
			\item	Time constraints
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{12pt}
		\pause
		Our case might be a little unrealistic though:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	You might often be the only (chemical) engineer on a team in a company
			\item	But that means you have to know \textbf{all your stuff}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Group selection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	How the process works: \textbf{mutual selection}. You get to choose 3 of the 4 other members.
		\item	But:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	TAs and myself will ultimately form the groups
			\item	We will try to select at least 2 of the people you choose
			\item	Tutorial slots evenly allocated
			\item	Not too many people of same stream in group
			\item	Interests
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Over to you ...}
	Please \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dERqREtHZUxVMkRuT2s4bnlzeTdXY2c6MA}{fill out the online questionnaire} \textbf{by the end of today}.



	\vspace{12pt}
	If you want to change something afterwards, refill the questionnaire again.

	\vspace{12pt}
	I will allocate groups on Saturday morning. First group-based tutorial is on Monday.
