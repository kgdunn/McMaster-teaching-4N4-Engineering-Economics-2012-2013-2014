\begin{frame}\frametitle{Group-based assignments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	``Appropriate'' group work is highly encouraged (about 40\% of course)
		\item	Learn with each other: groups of 2, no larger
		\hrule
		\item	Optimal group work: \emph{an example of one approach}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	Sarah and Brad work on an assignment
				\item	Both Sarah and Brad do {\color{myRed}{\textbf{all questions}}} in draft: quick notes at home, \emph{etc}, $\pm 4$ days before assignment due
				\item	Meet in the library and go over each other's notes
				\item	Explain to the other why you disagree
				\item	e.g. Sarah sees a mistaken interpretation in Brad's work
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	She explains why it is a mistake to Brad: Sarah learns
					\item	Brad also learns: he's heard this in class, and from Sarah now
					\item	If neither can resolve it? speak with TA or intructor					
				\end{itemize}
				\item	Write up a joint solution; e.g. Sarah does Q1 and 2, Brad does Q3
				\item	Both review it before submitting
			\end{itemize}
		\hrule
		\item	Other approaches are possible: you discuss what works
		\item	\color{myOrange}{What doesn't work}: Sarah does Q1 and Q2, Brad does Q3; staple and submit
	\end{itemize}
