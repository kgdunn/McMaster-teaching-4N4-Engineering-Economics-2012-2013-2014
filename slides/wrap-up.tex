\begin{frame}\frametitle{SDL after \texttt{4N04}}
	You will keep learning:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	from the plant
		\item	running experiments
		\item	talking with experts
		\item	website
		\item	company-sponsored courses, seminars and conferences
		\item	reading books, journal publications, trade journals
	\end{itemize}

		\item	Personal finance
		\item	Cash flows
		\item	Time value of money $\displaystyle F_n = \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}$

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Operability}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		Recognize the plant must still operate under conditions, and in situations, different to what it was designed for.
	\end{exampleblock}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	\textbf{Operating window} at steady state
		\item	\textbf{Flexibility} and controllability: degrees of freedom; what's manipulated? what's controlled?
		\item	\textbf{Reliability}: parallel and series structures; duplicate units
		\item	\textbf{Efficiency}: heat integration, recycle, different power sources
		\item	\textbf{Transitions}: maintenance, start-up and shut-down, regeneration, and grade changes. Bypass, batch-continuous interfaces; storage.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Troubleshooting}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	\emph{I want to and I can!}
		\item	\textbf{Define}: what is and isn't, where, when, who, what
		\item	\textbf{Explore}: fundamentals, important variables, cause-and-effect
		\item	\textbf{Plan and diagnose}: root causes in a table, collect evidence, initiate diagnostic experiments (actions)
		\item	\textbf{Implement}: short-term and long-term solutions
		\item	\textbf{Look back}: reflection ... what worked and what didn't
	\end{enumerate}

	\vspace{12pt}
	Preparing for the exam:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Please read Dr. Marlin's notes (not slides, the notes)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Safety
			\item	Operability
			\item	Troubleshooting
		\end{itemize}
		\item	Please review the slides, videos and material covered in class
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Thank you}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	For your patience with delays in returning graded material
		\item	For your feedback via the mid-term evaluations and anonymous evaluations
		\item	Some changes planned in 2013:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	More frequent required group ``check-ins'' with me
			\item	More time on troubleshooting and operability
			\item	Adjust presentation schedule and timing
			\item	Less emphasis on distillation columns, oil and gas systems; more bio, foods, pharma, pulp and paper, polymers
			\item	Integrate the Seider \emph{et al.} text book in 2013
			\item	Course will become more integrated with 4W4
			\item	Probably about the same amount of work and assignments in 2013 as this year
