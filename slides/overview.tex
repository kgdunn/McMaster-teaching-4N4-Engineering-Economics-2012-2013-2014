\begin{frame}\frametitle{How this course is structured}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	We aim to consider a variety of separation systems
		\item	Solids, liquids and gases
		\item	Cover unit operations that rely on:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	mechanical techniques to separate
			\item	mass transfer
			\item	heat transfer
			\item	phase creation or addition
		\end{itemize}
		\item	For each unit operation we consider
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	the physical principle that causes separation
			\item	how to size the unit and specify it
			\item	troubleshoot problems with the unit; optimize it (e.g. use less energy, increase separation efficiency)
			
		\end{itemize}
